## Challenges Faced
* **Data Fetching and Processing:** Obtaining and formatting quiz questions from an external API presented an initial hurdle. I overcame this by creating a custom function to fetch data, decode HTML entities, and structure questions in a user-friendly manner.
* **State Management:** Managing the state of questions, user responses, and timer updates was complex. I leveraged Redux for efficient state management and utilized Redux Toolkit for smoother development.
* **Timer Functionality:** Implementing a timer that counts down accurately and triggers specific actions when time is up was a technical challenge. I achieved this by utilizing React's useState and useEffect hooks along with Redux actions to handle time-related updates.
* **User Navigation:** Allowing users to navigate between questions while keeping track of visited, unvisited, and selected options required careful planning. I utilized conditional rendering and dynamic class assignments to highlight different question states.
